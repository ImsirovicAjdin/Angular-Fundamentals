12.03 Adding jQuery
Now that we've got our search results coming back, we need to display those search results, so we're going to start hooking up the UI. This is going to take a little bit, because it's not a trivial matter to hook up this modal dialog and wrap it correctly in Angular 2. As mentioned before, the Bootstrap modal dialog is part of Bootstrap, but it's actually utilized through jQuery. So we're going to need jQuery, which means that we've got to now have jQuery inside of our application. And jQuery is a third-party global, which means we got to do the same thing we did with Toastr. We've got to create a wrapping service for it. So let's start out by creating a wrapping service file, and we want to do pretty much what we did with the Toastr wrapper. Let's create a new file here, and I'm going to call that jQuery. service. ts, and I'm going to pretty much copy what we have in the Toastr service, except I'm not going to get the interface. jQuery's interface is far too complex to recreate. Let's change this. Let's set this type grammar to Object. At least it's slightly better than any. We're going to change the token from Toastr Token. We'll call this JQ Token. And of course we don't want the string to be Toastr. It'll be jQuery. And that's all we're going to do in this file, and now we've got a couple of places inside of this directory that we're exporting, so let's create a barrel file. Index. ts, and we'll export from the jQuery service and from Toastr, and from collapsible-well. We'll save those changes and go to our app module file. We need to do the same things we did with Toastr, but while we're in here, let's fix some AOT compilation problem. You may have already fixed this on your own. Change this, get rid of the declare. Let Toastr equal window toastr, and get this same thing for jQuery, though we won't give it a type, and we'll grab the $ variable. And up here where we're importing, we're going to import from our new index file. And from there we can grab the JQ TOKEN, the TOASTR TOKEN, and the Toastr interface. And we can delete that line now. And we can also get the collapsible-well from the same place. And now we've successfully got jQuery imported and wrapped, and we'll save our changes. And in the next section, we will start creating our modal.
