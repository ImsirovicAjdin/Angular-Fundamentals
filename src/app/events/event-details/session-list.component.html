9.3.2 Multiple Slot Content Projection
I want my title to end up right here, and then my body to end up right here. And back to our session list component HMTL, it's this piece of HTML that I want to show up right here. So we've got to tell Angular 2 that this piece of HTML should show up inside of this 'ng-content', whereas this piece of HTML here, should show up inside of this 'ng-content'. And we can do that by using the optional select attribute with an 'ng-content' tag. And the select attribute, works like any CSS selector. So I can give it a class selector with a dot, I can give it an ID with a hashtag. So I can use a CSS selector that we're familiar with. So I can go in here and change this title to a 'div'. And let's change that as well. And we'll do the same thing with body. And instead let's give this 'div' a class of title. And this 'div' a class of body. And now if I set my selector here to '. title', and add a select attribute to '. body', then Angular 2 will match up the correct content with the correct piece of HTML based on the class selectors. Now we've used class selectors a lot in the past to do things like this, but there's always the possibility that a class that we put in here could conflict with something that we have in a CSS file. So there's another way that we can do this. Instead of giving it a class, let's give it an attribute. Let's give this 'div' an attribute of 'well-title', and we'll give this 'div' an attribute of 'well-body'. Now in order to select that we change this from '. body' to the attribute selector 'well-body', and the same thing here, 'well-title'. I personally like this selector a little bit better than the class selector just for the reasons that I've mentioned, it doesn't give us a potential conflict with CSS classes, and I also think it stands out a little bit more saying that there's something about this 'div' that has to do with being a 'well-body', rather than hiding it inside the class, especially if we had a reason to have other class tags in here like pointable, or something else. We'd have to put our body class, our selector class alongside actual style classes which I really don't like. So this is the method that I recommend. As of right now the style guide doesn't have any opinion on how you do this. That may change in the future, so you can always refer there for more opinions. But this is what I like is to use an attribute like this. So let's save this HTML here, we'll go back to our component. We can make one further change, this title we don't have to bring in anymore as an input. And now if we go back to our HTML and refresh, the session lists look the same, they're still collapsible, but we've now got a little fire icon next to the sessions that have at least four votes. And that's how we can use multiple content projection with Angular 2. There also is a practice exercise for this clip, so you can take a moment to do that now.
