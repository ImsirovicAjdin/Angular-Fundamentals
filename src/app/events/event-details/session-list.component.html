9.2 Content Projection
Here in our events, if I click on a specific event we can see a list of the sessions. I'd like each of these session items to be collapsible. So if I click on this little well here, that it would collapse and just show the title of the session, and not the entire session. Now of course I could just go into the component here and add that functionality so that it can collapse and show just the session. But this sort of functionality is actually fairly reusable type of functionality. A component that can show a title and a detail, and collapse to just the title on click, and then expand just the title on the click. So let's implement that with a new reusable component. We're going to go into the session list page, and start in the HTML. And here I'll define how I want this to look. Right now I've got my 'div' with my column of 10 right here and then this 'div' with a class of well. I want to replace this with a new component. So let's write in the HTML ourselves. This will be a collapsible well. That'll be the name of the new component we create. And of course we have to tell it what the title is, we'll bind to a title property, and this we will set equal to the 'session. name'. And because we've done that we don't need this 'H4' anymore, so we're going to remove that. And down here instead of a close 'div', we'll have a close 'collapsible-well'. Now this is what our HTML will look like. Let's now create the component file. I'm going to create that in the common directory since this is a common component that could be used in any area. So in my common directory I'll create a new file called 'collapsible-well'. And this is going to be a component so I'll have to import component. Now just a quick note, notice that I put a semi-colon at the end of the line of code that I typed. I'm more of a semi-colon user, Jim is not so much. So you'll see some inconsistent styles here for a bit. We are going to address that later on in the course. And we'll create the component itself. The selector is collapsible well. And the template we'll define in line. We know that it's going to be a 'div'. And that 'div' is going to need a click event to handle when you click to toggle the visibility of the body. So let's go to click event and we'll just call a method named 'toggleContent'. Then we'll go with a class of well, and also pointable. Let's close up that div. And we know that our title was in a 'H4' so let's put that 'H4' here. And we'll give it a class of 'well-title'. And we'll bind to the title property. And finally we want our content to go here. For now I'm just going to leave this as a comment. Of course that comment doesn't actually work, because this is HTML. But we'll come back to this in just a second. Now let's create our class. And we know that it has one input property, which is a title, and a type string. We need to bring in input as well. And we know we need that toggle content method. And in this case we just want to toggle some visibility, so let's create a visible property. And inside of here we'll set it to the opposite value. And now we got the basics of our component, but the magic is going to be back up here on line eight. This is where we want our content to be. So were going to use a special tag which is the 'ng-content' tag. This element is what tells Angular whatever content exists inside of my component, which we can see back here in our session list, is all of this HTML right here, I want you to put it right here, and put it inside of it. So you can just close this up. And that's all we need to do in order to get the content projection to work, but of course we have our toggle content functionality, and to make that work we're going to want to toggle the visibility of this element itself. So let's just put an 'ngif' right here setting it to visible. And now our functionality will work to toggle that body content. Let's go back and save our session list component. And of course we have to add this to the module. So let's go to our module and down here where we got the 'common/toastr. service', this is probably the place we'll want to bring in this component as well, since it's inside the common directory. I could go in and create another index file, but just for simplicity I'm going to add its own line. And then of course we need to take this and add it to the declarations, so I'll just add it to the end. Now we'll save that change and we can go back out to our website. And let's refresh. And now if we've done things correctly, if we click on one of these session items, we can see that it's collapsing down to just show the title. And there's how we can use content projection to make a reusable component. There's a practice exercise for this clip, so take a moment to do that now.
