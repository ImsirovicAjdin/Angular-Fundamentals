9.3.1 Multiple Slot Content Projection
Our collapsible well is working, but let's now add another piece of functionality. I want to be able to indicate which of the sessions is extremely popular, and has a lot of votes. I'd like to do that by adding a little 'on fire' icon, next to the title of the session right about here. To implement this, I'll need to use some business logic that shows a flame icon if the session has a certain number of votes. This is obviously specific to a session if I were to add this kind of logic to the collapsible well it would tie it too closely to the specific implementation and not make it as generic and reusable as I'd like it to be. The problem is that our collapsible well currently can only bind to the title which is a string. Here we are using the collapsible well, I can send in my session name as my title, but I'd like to have a little bit more logic to show up inside of this 'h4' right here. I don't want just a simple 'h4' with a simple binding. I want some logic in there, and implement that inside of my collapsible well wouldn't be a good idea. So instead what I'd like to be able to do is have another area inside of my collapsible well. One for the title, and one for the body. Both areas being able to contain whatever HTML I want. Now this won't work exactly as is, because Angular doesn't understand what to do with these title and body sections, but we're going to come back and address that in just a minute. For now we're going to leave these tags where they are because they're illustrative and useful to us to understand what we're putting where. So we got our body, let's talk about how we'd implement the title. Now I want the name of the session to show up the same way we've got it bound right here. But I want it here in this section. And then next to the name, I want a little icon that's going to show up a flame red icon that will show up if we have at least a certain number of votes. I'll use the 'i' tag for that with an 'ngif' that will say we only want this to show up if the 'session. voters', which is the array of voters, has a length of greater than three. So if four or more people who've voted for a session. And I'll use a class of glyphicon, and 'glyphicon-fire' to use the fire icon, and we'll set that to red with a style attribute. And there's our fire icon. Now we can get rid of the title binding, because we're no longer getting our title that way, we're now getting it in the section. And again Angular 2 doesn't understand this title and this body attribute. Obviously body is a well known HTML attribute, so we can't have this as our body. Title we don't want to use that either. We need to tell Angular 2 that this is the title section and I want to stick it in a certain place, and this is the body section, and I want to stick it in a certain place. Let's go back to our well component and look at that. Here I've got our 'ng-content' tag that allows us to stick in whatever content is going to be inside of the collapsible well. And then of course we're bringing in the titles in input and we're binding it right here. So let's change this to work with instead of a bound title any HTML that we want. What we need is another 'ng-content'. We still want it to be inside of an 'h4' tag, but I want to change this class, I'm going to remove from the 'h4' tag and just do that as a wrapper. And instead, inside the 'h4' I'm using 'ng-content', and this is where I want my title to go.
