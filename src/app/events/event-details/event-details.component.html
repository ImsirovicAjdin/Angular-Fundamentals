10.05 Creating a Filtering Display
In this section, we're going to add filtering to some of our data. I want to filter our sessions list. If we look at a list of sample sessions, we can see that each session has a level. This session is an intermediate session, this one's also intermediate. This one's advanced and this one's advanced, and the last one is a beginner. So let's put four buttons right up here at the top, and the first one will be all, and that'll be selected by default. Then we'll have beginner, intermediate, and advanced next to each other, and whichever button you select, will filter the sessions list to just the sessions that match that level. So we're going to go to our code, and we're going to start in the event details HTML page. Right here is where we're going to put the buttons, and we're going to stick them inside of this div here. So let's start out by creating our all button, and then we want to put a binding to set which button is active. So we're going to use the class. active binding. That binds to the active class. So the active class will exist on this element if the following condition is true. Let's pause and keep this un filled in for the moment, and we'll come back to it. Next we're going to need a click event, and inside of our click event, we're going to set our filter condition, and again, we're going to pause and come back to this in just a minute, and finally we got the text. 'Kay, so there's our first button, and this one will be Beginner, this one'll be Intermediate, and the last one is going to be Advanced. Now let's talk about how we're going to implement this, and that will dictate what we put inside of the class. active binding, and the click binding as well. Let's go into our component, and here we've got the EventDetailsComponent class. This is where we want to implement our code. So what I want to implement is a filter property. I'm going to create a new property on this component and we'll call this filterBy. This is going to be a string, and I'm going to default it to the value all. I'm just going to use lowercase. It's not going to match the casing of the word in the display. Now this filterBy property starts off with a value of all, but it will switch at certain point to beginner, intermediate, or advanced and we'll just use lowercased strings for those, and save this, and go back into our HTML, we want our class to be active when the filterBy property equals the value all. Right, or the string all, which is why I put inside the single quotes here. And the same thing when we click this button, we want to set that filterBy property to the value of all. So we're just going to put that in line. We're just going to set it right there. Now that we know what we want inside of each of these, we can set these for each of the other three buttons. So let's start with the filterBys. This'll be beginner for the click event, intermediate, and finally advanced. And then we'll also set the class binding. Again, beginner. Scroll that down a little bit. Intermediate. And advanced last. So let's just go back to our HTML page and take a look at how that looks. 'Kay, we've got our buttons showing up, the all has the active class applied to it. Notice that there's no gap in between the buttons and this first session. It almost makes it look like tabs. Let's put a little bit of a gap in there. We're going to put in a style. We'll just give it an a margin bottom of 10 pixels, and let's look at that. All right, that looks okay.
