Okay, so we've covered how to communicate in and out of components using input and output properties, but there's one more way that we can use to access public properties and methods of a child component, and that can be quite useful for different use cases. This approach can be used 
to call methods on a child component
or
to bind to data in a child component.

And we can accomplish this using template reference variables.

Template reference variables (e.g #thumbanil above)

allow you to specify a variable name that points to a component, and then you can access any public properties or methods on that component using that variable. So let's check this out. Let's add a variable name to our event-thumbnail component and we'll just call it thumbnail, like this. 

Now this variable is available for us to use anywhere else in our template. So let's go create a public method on our child component that we can call. So over here in our thumbnail component

we'll just create a method called logFoo. 

And of course that will log foo. Alright, now back in our parent component, let's just 

add a button

that when we click on it it can call this new method on our child component. We'll just add that right here. And then we're going to wire up our click event to our thumbnail local variable, which is a pointer to our component, and so we can call the logFoo method on that component:

    <button (click)="thumbnail.logFoo()" ... etc ...></button>


Okay, let's save everything, and then let's go check that out. I'll refresh, and there is my button, and this is on my parent component, and if open up the console and then click this button, you can see that it logged the word foo. And so we were able to call thumbnail.logFoo and thumbnail is pointing to our event-thumbnail component and over in our event-thumbnail component this is where we actually logged foo. So you can see, this is actually a public method on our event thumbnail component, and you can see now we're able to access that using a reference variable. I really like how straightforward that is. In some ways this is more simple than input and output parameters. And there's another case where we can use this template variable, and that is 

if we want the parent to bind to a public property on a child component. 

So let's add a property on the thumbnail component. We'll just add that right here, and we'll call it someProperty. And let's just set that to a string. And now we can access that someProperty property over in our parent component using our template variable. So let's add an h3 here, and then we'll just bind directly to this with interpolation. So again here we're using ut thumbnail local variable and we're going to access someProperty. Okay, let's go check this out. You can see that some value is being written out here to our parent component even though that value is in our child component. And we can access that using our thumbnail template variable. Okay, so that's the thee different ways that you can handle inter-component communication:
input properties, 
output properties, and 
template variables. 

And we're not going to need this template variable stuff, so let's just go ahead and clean that up, and we'll clean it up over here in our child component too. Okay, that's all there is to local variables, and there's a practice exercise for this clip, so go check that out.
